- For searching search frienldy database like elastic search should be used
- there could be fuzzy factor ie edit distance
- also search dbs are based on invetred index
- whenever we add/upadate a record it will be indexed for a word to document containing the word or similar word
- as each write/update will occupy the CPU for updating the index, preference to read to be given as the user is very much engaged with search and write/update could be eventually consistent
