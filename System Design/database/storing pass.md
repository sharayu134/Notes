When saving passwords in any database, including Google Cloud Spanner, it is essential to implement best practices for security to protect those passwords from unauthorized access. Here are the recommended steps for securely storing passwords:

### 1. Use a Strong Hashing Algorithm

Never store passwords in plaintext. Instead, use a strong, one-way hashing algorithm to hash passwords before storing them. Commonly used algorithms include:

- **bcrypt**: A popular hashing function designed for secure password storage. It includes a built-in salt and is adjustable for computational cost.
- **Argon2**: The winner of the Password Hashing Competition and recommended for its resistance to various attack vectors.
- **PBKDF2**: A key derivation function that uses hashing and salts to make brute-force attacks more difficult.

### 2. Generate and Use a Unique Salt

- A **salt** is a random value added to the password before hashing. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.
- Generate a unique salt for each password and store it alongside the hashed password.

### 3. Store the Hashed Password and the Salt

In your Spanner table, create columns for both the hashed password and the salt. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT64 NOT NULL,
    Username STRING(255) NOT NULL,
    HashedPassword STRING(255) NOT NULL,
    Salt STRING(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (UserID)
);
```

### 4. Hash and Store the Password

When a user creates an account or changes their password:

1. Generate a random salt.
2. Combine the password with the salt.
3. Hash the combined string using your chosen hashing algorithm.
4. Store the hashed password and the salt in the database.

### 5. Verify the Password

When a user attempts to log in:

1. Retrieve the stored hashed password and salt for the user from the database.
2. Combine the entered password with the stored salt.
3. Hash the combined string using the same hashing algorithm.
4. Compare the newly generated hash with the stored hashed password. If they match, the password is correct.

### Example Code Snippet (Using bcrypt in Python)

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might handle password hashing and verification using the `bcrypt` library in Python:

```python
import bcrypt

# Hashing a password
def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed_password.decode('utf-8'), salt.decode('utf-8')

# Verifying a password
def verify_password(stored_hashed_password, stored_salt, provided_password):
    hashed_provided_password = bcrypt.hashpw(provided_password.encode('utf-8'), stored_salt.encode('utf-8'))
    return hashed_provided_password == stored_hashed_password.encode('utf-8')

# Example usage
password = "my_secure_password"
hashed_password, salt = hash_password(password)

# Store `hashed_password` and `salt` in Spanner DB...

# When verifying
is_valid = verify_password(hashed_password, salt, "attempted_password")
print("Password is valid:", is_valid)
```

### Summary

1. **Never store passwords in plaintext**.
2. Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
3. Generate a unique salt for each password and store it.
4. Use the same hashing method for verifying user credentials.

By following these practices, you'll significantly enhance the security of user passwords stored in your Google Cloud Spanner database.
