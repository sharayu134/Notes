* why needed
* while developing application we need to add all the services and database and whole lot of set up to do
* each of the developer will have to do this
* all may have differernt operating system, so different procedure to do the installations
* this leads to a lot of rework

* with docker
* you will have the container with all the dependencies including database, npm, java, node
* for each operating system docker cmds are same
* same thing can be used for both development and deployment time

* How this works
