* why needed
* while developing application we need to add all the services and database and whole lot of set up to do
* each of the developer will have to do this
* all may have differernt operating system, so different procedure to do the installations
* this leads to a lot of rework

* with docker
* you will have the container with all the dependencies including database, npm, java, node
* for each operating system docker cmds are same
* same thing can be used for both development and deployment time

* How this works

* docker image vs docker container
* ![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
* one image can have multiple container / instance

* Docker Registery
* storage for image distribution
* biggest docker registry -> biggest docker Hub -> all oficial images will be presenr https://hub.docker.com/
* official image -> redis image created by redis team
