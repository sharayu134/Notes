   ## 1. Selection sort -> select min -> but from where? -> from a unsorted array -> in first round all the elements are unsorted -> so you loop this unsorted array to get the smallest and repalce with position 0 i.e index 0 element is now a sorted array and [ 1 to n-1] is unsorted repreat the same [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/]
   
   ## 2. Bubble sort -> largest elelment will bubble out its way to end of the list -> n time compare two consecutive elements and switch the largest to second element [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/]
   
   ## 3. Insertion sort -> Insert element to a sorted list, we start with one element, which is sorted, and then we move to the next and we insert this element to sorted array we compare it with the left one and swap if required and now we have sorted array with 2 ele now we move in to next index https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/
