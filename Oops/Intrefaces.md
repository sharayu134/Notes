* has interfaces keyword
* interface is a constract 
* contract between creator and consumer of interface
* error being thrown if error is thrown if anything is changed
* tight contract -> what is benefit _> here ther will be no way to find out the change interface gives this option -> we get error / alert [impact analysis]
* best practice to change the interface is not to change the interface -> create a new interface and implement it [mult interface ] to add the extra method this way nothing will change which is already implemented only we have to add new things
* 
* always give proper examples like bank account hospital not cat dog
* interface methods don't have implementation -> (from java 8 we can create)
* everything is public always you cannot write private 
* other classes implements interface
* **multiple interface**
* cannot instanciate
