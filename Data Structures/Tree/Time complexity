# O(n) as each node is visited only once 
n is number of nodes in tree


Tree Traversal vs. Graph Traversal
Tree traversal and graph traversal are both techniques for visiting all nodes of a data structure, but they differ due to the fundamental differences between trees and graphs.

Tree Traversal
Structure: Trees have a hierarchical structure with a single root node.   
Paths: There is only one unique path between any two nodes.   
Cycles: Cycles are not allowed.   
Traversal methods: Pre-order, in-order, post-order.   
Graph Traversal
Structure: Graphs are non-linear structures with no specific order or hierarchy.   
Paths: There can be multiple paths between two nodes, or no path at all.   
Cycles: Cycles are allowed.
Traversal methods: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).   
Key Differences
Feature	Tree	Graph
Structure	Hierarchical	Non-linear
Paths	Unique	Multiple or none
Cycles	Not allowed	Allowed
Traversal methods	Pre-order, in-order, post-order	BFS, DFS

In essence:

Tree traversal is simpler due to the hierarchical structure.
Graph traversal is more complex due to the potential for cycles and multiple paths.

if tree is a graph can you please prove that it's traversal complexity is (V+E)

Tree as a Graph: Proof of O(V+E) Traversal Complexity
Understanding the Premise
A tree is indeed a special type of graph. Specifically, it's a connected, acyclic graph. This means:

Connected: Every node can be reached from any other node.
Acyclic: There are no cycles (no paths that start and end at the same node without repeating edges).
Proof of O(V+E) Complexity
To traverse a tree (or any graph), we typically use either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's analyze the complexity of these algorithms in the context of a tree.

Key Points:
Number of vertices (V): The total number of nodes in the tree.
Number of edges (E): In a tree, the number of edges is always V-1 (due to its acyclic property).
BFS or DFS Analysis:
Visiting Vertices: Each vertex is visited exactly once in both BFS and DFS. This contributes to a time complexity of O(V).
Exploring Edges: For each vertex, we explore its adjacent vertices (children in the case of a tree). Since we visit each edge exactly twice (once from each endpoint), the total time spent exploring edges is O(2E) which simplifies to O(E).
Combining the Analysis:
The total time complexity for traversing a tree is the sum of the time spent visiting vertices and exploring edges:

Time complexity = O(V) + O(E) = O(V + E)
Since E = V-1 for a tree, the complexity can also be expressed as O(V + (V-1)) = O(2V) = O(V).

Conclusion
Therefore, traversing a tree using either BFS or DFS has a time complexity of O(V+E), which simplifies to O(V) due to the specific properties of trees.

This analysis holds true because:

Each vertex is visited exactly once.
Each edge is explored exactly twice.
By understanding the relationship between vertices and edges in a tree, we can efficiently calculate the time complexity of traversal algorithms.
