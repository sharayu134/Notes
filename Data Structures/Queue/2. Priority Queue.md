# PQ aka Heap in python

```
  pq = [4,6,2,9]
  heapq.heapify(pq)
  heapq.heappop(pq)
  heapq.heappush(10)

```
1. python has min heap by default
2. to create max heap add negatives of all the numbers
3. be careful when you pop them as they will be negative might need to convert them back to int
4. Time complexities of heap function
   
**heapify(x)**: Builds a heap from a list in-place. Time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the list.
**heappush(heap, item)**: Pushes an item onto the heap. Time complexity is **O(log n)** for each item.
**heappop(heap)**: Removes and returns the smallest item from the heap. Time complexity is **O(log n)**.
