# Union Find
    
 This help us to split elememnts into one or more disjoint set
It has two primary functions -> union() and find()
    ## find() -> find the group which elelment belongs to 
    ## union() -> will merge the two groups
    ## path compression makes things more easier ->
make every element point to the alpha parent node make this change while inomelenting the find ,
this code is there in next/next file
    ## but if you want to access/use the final parent arr then you must call final(par[i]) as this will give you final parent **IMPVV**
