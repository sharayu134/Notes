    ## This help us to split elememnts into one or more disjoint set
    ## It has two primary functions -> union() and find()
    ## find() -> find the group which elelment belongs to 
    ## union() -> will merge the two groups
    ## path compression makes things more easier -> make every element point to the alpha parent node make this change while inomelenting the find , thie code is there in next/next file
