balanced binary search tree.

bisect_left() is a function from the bisect module in Python that efficiently finds the insertion point for an element in a sorted sequence. It returns the index where the element would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Key points:

Sorted sequence: The input sequence must be sorted in ascending order.
Insertion point: The function returns the index where the element should be inserted to keep the sequence sorted.
Left bias: If the element is already present in the sequence, bisect_left() returns the leftmost index where the element can be inserted.
Example:

Python
import bisect

sequence = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
index = bisect.bisect_left(sequence, 3)
print(index)  # Output: 2
