## DFS :

To get Max connected nodes below

a.     b

\       /

    c

    |

   d

    |

    e

Difference between DFS techniques

1. Use visited array to get the max, to include each and every route visited max will be 5
2. Only use counter to get the max this will give you only longest root to the depth that is 4






I need your help to understand whats hapning in code one of the solution is wrong and one correct why is that

class Solution1:
def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
rows = len(grid)
cols = len(grid[0])
cnt = 0

def dfs(i , j):
if i<0 or j<0 or i>=rows or j>=cols:
return False
if grid[i][j] == 1:
return True

grid[i][j] = 1

a = dfs(i-1,j)
b = dfs(i+1, j)
c = dfs(i, j-1)
d = dfs(i,j+1)
return a and b and c and d

for k in range(rows):
for l in range(cols):
if grid[k][l]==0 and dfs(k,l):
cnt+=1
return cnt

class Solution2:
def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
rows = len(grid)
cols = len(grid[0])
cnt = 0

def dfs(i , j):
if i<0 or j<0 or i>=rows or j>=cols:
return False
if grid[i][j] == 1:
return True

grid[i][j] = 1

return dfs(i-1,j) and dfs(i+1, j) and dfs(i, j-1) and dfs(i,j+1)


for k in range(rows):
for l in range(cols):
if grid[k][l]==0 and dfs(k,l):
cnt+=1
return cnt

Understanding the Code and the Issue
Code Breakdown
Both Solution1 and Solution2 attempt to count the number of closed islands in a given grid. A closed island is defined as a group of connected 0s surrounded by 1s (land).

The core logic in both solutions is a Depth-First Search (DFS) function to explore neighboring cells. The difference lies in how the DFS function handles the return value.

The Issue
Solution2 is incorrect.

The problem with Solution2 is that it returns True immediately after marking the current cell as visited, without exploring all neighbors. This means that if the first neighbor encountered is land (1), the function will return True without checking the other neighbors. This can lead to incorrect results, as a closed island requires all neighbors to be either land or part of the same island.

Solution1 is correct.

In Solution1, the DFS function explores all neighbors recursively and returns True only if all neighbors are either land or part of the same island. This correctly identifies closed islands.

Explanation
To illustrate the difference, consider the following scenario:

[0,0,1]
[1,1,1]
[0,0,1]
In this case, there is no closed island. However, Solution2 would incorrectly count one closed island because the DFS function would return True for the top-left corner without exploring all neighbors.

Conclusion
The key difference between the two solutions is the handling of the return value in the DFS function. Solution1 correctly ensures that all neighbors are explored before determining if a cell is part of a closed island, while Solution2 prematurely returns True without considering all possibilities.

Therefore, Solution1 is the correct implementation for counting closed islands.

## IMP time complexity for bfs and dfs

Time Complexity of DFS and BFS: A Simple Explanation
Imagine a maze.



DFS (Depth-First Search)
Think of DFS as exploring a maze by going as deep as possible before backtracking. You start at an entrance, pick a path, and keep going until you hit a dead end. Then, you go back to the last junction and try another path.



Time complexity: You visit every room (vertex) and every door (edge) at most once. So, the time it takes is directly related to the number of rooms (vertices) and doors (edges) in the maze.
BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Imagine BFS as exploring a maze level by level. You start at the entrance and explore all rooms on the first floor, then move to the second floor, and so on.



Time complexity: Similar to DFS, you visit every room and door at most once. So, the time it takes is also related to the number of rooms and doors.
In both cases, the time it takes to explore the entire maze depends on the number of rooms (vertices) and doors (edges).



In technical terms:
V is the number of vertices (rooms).
E is the number of edges (doors).
The time complexity for both DFS and BFS is O(V + E).



This means
that the time it takes to explore the entire maze (or graph) grows linearly with the number of rooms and doors.
