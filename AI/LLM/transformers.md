Transformers are a type of deep learning model architecture that has become the foundation for many large language models (LLMs). They were introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Transformers are designed to handle sequential data and are particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks.

Key components of transformers include:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a particular word. It helps the model understand the context and relationships between words.

2. **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of words, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each word in the sequence.

3. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: The original transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a context-aware representation, while the decoder uses this representation to generate the output sequence.

4. **Multi-Head Attention**: This extends the self-attention mechanism by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing various aspects of the context.

5. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**: Each layer in the transformer includes a feed-forward neural network that processes the output of the attention mechanism.

6. **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: These techniques help stabilize and improve the training of deep neural networks.

Transformers have led to significant advancements in NLP, enabling the development of powerful models like BERT, GPT, and T5, which are capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
