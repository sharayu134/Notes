# Retrieval Augmented Generation

* LLMs provide calling vector databases to provide key sources of databases
* When LLMs asked questions on data which they are not trained this will limit llm
* like if they are asked about Q1 revenue for my company in north east, LLM simply does not have the data
* here we can provide LLM with vector database
