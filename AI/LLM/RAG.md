# Retrieval Augmented Generation

* LLMs provide calling vector databases to provide key sources of databases
* When LLMs asked questions on data which they are not trained this will limit llm
* like if they are asked about Q1 revenue for my company in north east, LLM simply does not have the data
* here we can provide LLM with vector database
* Vector database is mathematical representation of structured and unstructured data
* these representation of data is easily understandable by machine learning models
* when we query vector database we will get embeddings of relavent data
* this data is fed to LLM which will provide output
