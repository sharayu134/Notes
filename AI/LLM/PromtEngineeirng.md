principles
* clear and specific instruction
* give model time to think


# clear and specific instruction
* short prompts are not clear, give long

Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML

- #### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
