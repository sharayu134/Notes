Declaring variables
var / let / const

var -> Declaring space assigning taht I know
    string "swd"
    bool true
    number 3
    var payment; -> not assigned value/type
    console.log(payment) -> undefined

    change it again
    const a ="something"
    a="anotherThing" -> TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
