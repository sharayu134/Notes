Candidate generation is the first stage of recommendation. Given a query, the system generates a set of relevant candidates. The following table shows two common candidate generation approaches:

Type |	Definition |	Example
content-based filtering | 	Uses similarity between items to recommend items similar to what the user likes. |	If user A watches two cute cat videos, then the system can recommend cute animal videos to that user.
collaborative filtering	| Uses similarities between queries and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. |	If user A is similar to user B, and user B likes video 1, then the system can recommend video 1 to user A (even if user A hasnâ€™t seen any videos similar to video 1).
