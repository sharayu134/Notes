Aho-Corasick: For the V1 task of checking a long string against a fixed list of 50-100 names (including variations like "QuickBase," "quickbase," "Quick base"), highly optimized multi-pattern string matching algorithms like the Aho-Corasick algorithm can perform the entire check in time proportional to the length of the post, often in microseconds. This is far faster than any ML inference, even on a compressed model.
