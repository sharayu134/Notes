## üí¨ Example Interview Prompts

* Design a **search system for a marketplace (Mercari-like)**.
* How would you **recommend items to a new user** (cold start problem)?
* Explain how you‚Äôd **update recommendations in real time**.
* How would you **evaluate and deploy** your recommendation system?

---

Would you like me to create a **detailed weekly study plan** (with resources, readings, and mock interview questions) specifically for *Search & Recommendation System Design*? That would make your preparation more structured.
Of course! For a large-scale system design interview on search and recommendations, especially if you're new to ML, you should focus on the **system components and their interactions** rather than deep ML theory. The interviewer wants to see how you connect business goals to a scalable, real-world architecture.

Here are the key topics you should cover, broken down logically from data to user experience.

***

### ## Foundational Concepts

First, be crystal clear on the difference between search and recommendation. This is a common starting point.

* **Search is about intent.** The user explicitly tells you what they want via a query (e.g., "blue running shoes"). The main challenge is **relevance**: understanding the query and finding the best matching items from a massive catalog.
* **Recommendation is about discovery.** The system proactively suggests items the user might like based on their past behavior, similar users, or item attributes (e.g., Netflix suggesting movies). The main challenge is **personalization**: predicting user preferences without an explicit query.

***

### ## 1. The Data & Feature Pipeline (The Foundation)

Every ML system is built on data. You need to explain how you would collect, process, and store the necessary information.

* **Data Ingestion**: How do you get the raw signals?
    * **User Data**: Profile information, demographics.
    * **Item Data**: Product descriptions, movie genres, song metadata, etc.
    * **Interaction Data**: This is the most important! Clicks, views, purchases, likes, search queries. This is usually captured as a stream of events using tools like **Kafka** or **Kinesis**.
* **Feature Engineering & Storage**: How do you turn raw data into useful signals (features) for your models?
    * **User Features**: `user_id`, `country`, `preferred_categories`, `purchase_history`.
    * **Item Features**: `item_id`, `category`, `price`, `brand`, `text_description`.
    * **Contextual Features**: `time_of_day`, `device_type`.
    * **The Feature Store**: This is a key concept to mention. A feature store is a centralized repository for features that decouples feature creation from model training and serving. It ensures consistency between the features used to train a model (offline) and the features used for predictions in real-time (online).

***

### ## 2. The Core Two-Stage Architecture (The "ML" Part)

At scale, you can't score every single item for a user; it's too slow. The standard solution is a two-stage "funnel" architecture. Explain this pattern clearly. It's like finding a needle in a haystack: first, you quickly get rid of most of the hay, then you carefully inspect what's left.



#### **Stage 1: Candidate Generation (or Retrieval)**

The goal here is **speed and recall**. From millions of items, quickly select a few hundred potentially relevant candidates. It's okay to have some false positives.

* **Content-Based Filtering**: "You liked sci-fi movies, so here are more sci-fi movies." This uses **item features**. Simple, and great for solving the "cold start" problem for new users.
* **Collaborative Filtering**: "Users similar to you also liked these items." This uses the **user-item interaction matrix**. It's powerful for discovering new interests.
* **Embeddings**: This is the modern, scalable approach. You represent users and items as vectors (a list of numbers) in a high-dimensional space. Users and items that are "close" in this vector space are considered similar. You can pre-compute these embeddings and use an efficient search index (like **FAISS** or **ScaNN**) to find the "approximate nearest neighbors" very quickly. **This is a huge topic to know.**

#### **Stage 2: Ranking (or Scoring)**

The goal here is **precision and relevance**. Take the smaller set of candidates (~100-500) from the previous stage and rank them accurately. Since you're dealing with a much smaller set, you can use more complex models and features.

* **Model**: You can use anything from a simple **Logistic Regression** model to more complex **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (like XGBoost)** or a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**.
* **Features**: The ranking model uses a rich set of features:
    * Features about the user (`user_id`, `country`).
    * Features about the item (`item_id`, `category`).
    * Features about the user-item interaction (e.g., `has_user_clicked_this_item_before?`).
    * Scores from the candidate generation stage.
* **Objective**: The model is trained to predict a business goal, like the probability of a click (`p(click)`) or purchase (`p(purchase)`). The final list is sorted by this score.

***

### ## 3. The Serving System (Making it Fast)

This is about the real-time infrastructure that delivers the recommendations to the user in under 200 milliseconds.

* **API Design**: The user-facing service that takes a `user_id` and returns a ranked list of `item_id`s.
* **Offline vs. Online Computation**:
    * **Offline**: Things that are computationally expensive are done in batches (e.g., daily or hourly). This includes training the main ranking models and generating item embeddings.
    * **Online**: Things that need to be done in real-time when a request comes in. This includes fetching user features, retrieving candidates from the index, and scoring them with the ranking model.
* **Caching**: Aggressively cache everything you can. You can cache the final ranked lists for the home page, popular items, or even results for specific users for a short period.

***

### ## 4. Evaluation & The Feedback Loop

How do you know if your system is working and how do you improve it?

* **Offline Metrics**: Before deploying, you test your model on a historical dataset. Key metrics include **Precision**, **Recall**, and **NDCG** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).
* **Online Metrics & A/B Testing**: This is the gold standard. You deploy your new model to a small percentage of users and compare its performance against the old model. Key metrics are business-focused: **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**, **Conversion Rate**, and **User Engagement**. This closed loop (serving -> measuring -> retraining) is how the system improves over time.

***

### ## 5. Important Real-World Challenges üëç

Mentioning these shows you have a deeper, practical understanding.

* **The Cold Start Problem**: What do you do for a new user (no interaction history) or a new item (no one has interacted with it)?
    * *Solution*: For new users, fall back to showing popular items or using demographic data. For new items, use content-based features to recommend them to relevant users.
* **Explore vs. Exploit**: A classic trade-off. Do you **exploit** what you know and keep showing the user items they are likely to click, or do you **explore** by showing new items to learn more about their tastes? This prevents the user from getting stuck in a "filter bubble."
* **Bias & Fairness**: Be aware that models can create feedback loops that reinforce biases (e.g., only showing items to a certain demographic). Mentioning the need for fairness and potentially re-ranking for diversity is a sign of a mature engineer.
