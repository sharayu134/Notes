ML system design interviews often go beyond simple definitions and focus on how you'd apply decision trees in a real-world, production-level system. The questions test your ability to think about the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model deployment and maintenance.

### Foundational Questions üìö

These questions test your core knowledge and are the starting point for a deeper discussion.

* **When would you choose a Decision Tree over another algorithm like Logistic Regression or SVM?** The expected answer should highlight their unique strengths: **interpretability** (you can visualize and explain the "if-then" rules), and their ability to handle **non-linear relationships** and **mixed data types** (categorical and numerical) without feature scaling. You would mention that they are a good baseline model.
* **What are the primary challenges or disadvantages of using a single Decision Tree?** This leads to a discussion of **overfitting** (high variance), **instability** (small changes in data can create a completely different tree), and their tendency to be **biased towards the majority class** in imbalanced datasets.
* **How do you prevent a Decision Tree from overfitting?** The key terms here are **pruning** (pre-pruning and post-pruning) and **hyperparameter tuning**. You should explain how parameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, and `min_samples_split` are used to control the tree's complexity.

### System Design & Application Questions ‚öôÔ∏è

These questions require you to think about how a decision tree would fit into a larger system.

* **Design a system to predict whether a customer will churn.**
    * **Data Sources**: What data would you collect (customer demographics, usage history, support tickets)?
    * **Preprocessing**: Would you need to handle missing values or transform features? You should explain that decision trees don't require feature scaling.
    * **Model Selection**: Why would a Decision Tree be a good choice for this problem? You'd highlight its interpretability, which is valuable for business stakeholders who need to understand *why* a customer is predicted to churn. You'd also mention that you'd likely start with a simple Decision Tree and then move to more robust **ensemble methods** like Random Forest or XGBoost.
    * **Training & Deployment**: How would you train the model? How would you save and deploy it to make real-time predictions? A great answer would mention using a **`scikit-learn` Pipeline** to encapsulate preprocessing and the model, ensuring consistency between training and serving.

* **How would you scale a Decision Tree model to handle a dataset with hundreds of millions of data points?**
    * This is a key question for production systems. You should explain that a standard Decision Tree algorithm can be slow and memory-intensive on a single machine.
    * You would discuss using a distributed framework like **Spark's MLlib** or a library designed for large datasets like **LightGBM** or **XGBoost**, which are highly optimized for training tree-based models on massive amounts of data. You should also mention techniques like **data partitioning** and **feature subsampling**.

### Ensemble Methods and Beyond üöÄ

Interviewers will almost always transition from a single Decision Tree to ensemble methods.

* **Explain the difference between a Random Forest and a Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost) in a system design context.**
    * **Random Forest**: You would describe it as a **bagging** method. It builds many independent decision trees in parallel, with each tree trained on a random subset of the data and features. It reduces **variance** by averaging or majority-voting the predictions.
    * **Gradient Boosting**: You would describe it as a **boosting** method. It builds trees sequentially, with each new tree trying to correct the errors (residuals) of the previous ones. It reduces **bias** by iteratively improving the model's performance.
    * **System Implications**: You'd note that Random Forests are naturally parallelizable and easier to train, making them good for simpler systems. XGBoost is often more accurate but requires more careful tuning and is computationally more complex.

* **How would you handle a highly imbalanced dataset (e.g., fraud detection) using a tree-based model?**
    * You should explain that a single Decision Tree would be biased towards the majority class.
    * You would propose **ensemble methods** (like Random Forest) which can be configured to handle class imbalance (e.g., by adjusting class weights). You'd also mention other techniques like **oversampling** the minority class (SMOTE) or **undersampling** the majority class during the data preprocessing step.
