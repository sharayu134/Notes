In statistics, normality refers to a dataset or a variable following a normal distribution. This is also known as a Gaussian distribution or the bell curve. 
The normal distribution is a specific, symmetrical shape that appears frequently in nature and social sciences. Many natural phenomena, such as a person's height, blood pressure, or test scores, tend to be normally distributed. This means that most values cluster around a central average, with values becoming less frequent the further they are from the average.
Key Characteristics of a Normal Distribution
 * Symmetry: The curve is a perfect mirror image on either side of the center.
 * Central Tendency: The mean, median, and mode are all located at the exact center of the distribution.
 * **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule): For a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
Normality in Different Contexts
 * Statistics: Many statistical tests, like t-tests and ANOVA, assume that the data or the residuals are normally distributed. This assumption is crucial for the reliability of the test results.
 * Chemistry: In chemistry, "normality" is a measure of concentration. It is defined as the number of gram equivalents of a solute per liter of solution. This is a very different definition from the statistical one and is often used in acid-base reactions and titrations.
