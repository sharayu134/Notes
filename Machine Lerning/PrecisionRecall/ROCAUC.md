### 1. Confusion Matrices vary by threshold

* In a binary classifier (e.g. logistic regression), you often get a **probability score** for each sample.
* To decide class labels, you choose a **threshold** (e.g. 0.5).
* Varying the threshold changes **True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives** → you’ll get different confusion matrices.
* You might want to examine performance across **all thresholds**, rather than just one.

### 2. ROC Curve

* **ROC curve** plots **True Positive Rate (TPR)** vs **False Positive Rate (FPR)** for different thresholds.

  * TPR = Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
  * FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
* Each point on the ROC curve corresponds to one threshold.
* A “perfect” classifier would go to the top-left corner (TPR = 1, FPR = 0).
* The diagonal line (from bottom-left to top-right) is the “no-skill” line (random guessing).

### 3. AUC (Area Under the Curve)

* **AUC** is the **area under the ROC curve**.
* It gives a single scalar metric summarizing how good the classifier is across all thresholds.
* Higher AUC = generally better classification (i.e. you have high TPR and low FPR over many thresholds).
* AUC = 0.5 is baseline (no better than random).

### 4. Model Comparison using AUC

* Because AUC collapses threshold-level performance, it lets you compare two models **independent of threshold**.
* The model with higher AUC is “better” in the sense of ranking predictions (i.e. giving higher scores to positives vs negatives).

### 5. Caveats & Related Metrics

* ROC & AUC don’t directly consider **precision**; for imbalanced datasets, precision-recall curves are often more informative.
* The video also notes that sometimes data might not behave nicely (i.e. overlaps, noise) → so ROC / AUC interpretation needs care.
* Differences in class prevalence / cost of false positives vs false negatives might require choosing the “operating point” (threshold) carefully, rather than relying solely on AUC.

## ✅ Why This Matters (Especially for ML Interviews / System Design)

When interviewing for machine learning roles, especially ones involving evaluation of models or designing classification systems, the understanding of ROC/AUC is often tested. Here’s how:

* **Model evaluation & metrics**: You need to know when ROC / AUC is appropriate vs when precision-recall, F1 score, etc.
* **Threshold selection**: Interviewers may ask, “Once I have probability outputs, how do I pick a cutoff? What tradeoffs exist (TP vs FP)?”
* **Comparing models**: They may ask, “Model A has higher accuracy, but Model B has higher AUC — which do you prefer and why?”
* **System implications**: In a deployed system, class imbalance, cost of errors, and operational thresholds matter. Knowing ROC/AUC helps you reason about how the system behaves as you adjust thresholds or deal with distribution shifts.
* **Edge cases and pitfalls**: Be ready to discuss scenario when AUC is misleading (e.g. extremely imbalanced classes, or when precision matters more).
